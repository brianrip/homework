## Week 4

##### Day 1
  * Store the id of the last tool added to ToolChest in the session with a key of `:most_recent_tool_id`.
  * Add a method to your `ApplicationController` called `most_recent_tool` that loads the most recent tool using `:most_recent_tool_id` stored in the session. (Hint: use `Tool.find...`)
  * Make that new method available to your views by making it a [helper method](http://apidock.com/rails/AbstractController/Helpers/ClassMethods/helper_method).
  * Add this snippet to `application.html.erb`:
  
 ```erb
 <p>
   <strong>Newest tool:</strong> <%= most_recent_tool.name %>
 </p>
 ```
  * Implement a `flash[:notice]` in the ToolsController `#create` action for when you successfully create a tool. Extension: Modify your `#create` action to conditionally create a tool depending on whether or not a name is provided. Then create a `flash[:error]` that holds `@tool.errors.full_messages.join(", ")`. 
  * Use a dynamic content generator to display the flash notice. Take a look at 20:33 in the [Sessions, Cookies, and Flashes](https://vimeo.com/130058574) video for a refresher on how to do this.
  * Watch [this video on authentication](https://vimeo.com/134451454) in preparation for tomorrow's class. Prepare questions for class tomorrow and be ready for a code-along in the morning.
